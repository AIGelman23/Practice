		<p style="border: 1px dotted #000000;padding:20px; background-color:lightblue;">Hi my name is Ariel Gelman, and you can find more about my personal life through my homepage. If you are interested in reading more about my academic career you might want to consider heading on over to my biography located in the navigational menu bar. By reading my biography, I hope you can get a better understanding of who I am as an individual. I have also listed contact information for those who feel so inclined as to reach me by letter, e-mail, or social media such as LinkedIn or Facebook. I am happy to answer any questions that you may have for me.

For those further interested in my services as an employee I have listed my current and up-to-date resume complete with my previous job experience as well as rewards and all of the academic institutions I have attended throughout my career as a student in both high school and college. I hope this site serves as a way of providing more information about me to other students, employers, and people in general who may not have known about me.</p>
